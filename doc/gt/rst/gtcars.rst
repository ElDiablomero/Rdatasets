specifications such as horsepower, torque, EPA MPG ratings, type of
drivetrain, and transmission characteristics are provided. The country
of origin for the car manufacturer is also given.

trsmn
   The codified transmission type, where the number part is the number

   (``am``), or, direct drive (``dd``)

Details
~~~~~~~

All of the ``gtcars`` have something else in common (aside from the high
asking prices): they are all grand tourer vehicles. These are proper GT
cars that blend pure driving thrills with a level of comfort that is
more expected from a fine limousine (e.g., a Rolls-Royce Phantom EWB).
You'll find that, with these cars, comfort is emphasized over all-out
performance. Nevertheless, the driving experience should also mean
motoring at speed, doing so in style and safety.
