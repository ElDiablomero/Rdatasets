A toy example tibble for testing with gt: exibble
-------------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

This tibble contains data of a few different classes, which makes it
well-suited for quick experimentation with the functions in this
package. It contains only eight rows with numeric, character, and factor
columns. The last 4 rows contain ``NA`` values in the majority of this
tibble's columns (1 missing value per column). The ``date``, ``time``,
and ``datetime`` columns are character-based dates/times in the familiar
ISO 8601 format. The ``row`` and ``group`` columns provide for unique
rownames and two groups (``grp_a`` and ``grp_b``) for experimenting with
the ``gt()`` function's ``rowname_col`` and ``groupname_col`` arguments.

Usage
~~~~~

::

   exibble

Format
~~~~~~

A tibble with 8 rows and 9 variables:

num

fctr
   a factor column with numbers from 1 to 8, written out

date, time, datetime
   character columns with dates, times, and datetimes

currency

row
   a character column in the format ``row_X`` which can be useful for

   values which can be useful for testing tables that contain row groups
