Turnip prices in Animal Crossing (New Horizons)
-----------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

A data set on turnip prices from my experience with Animal Crossing (New
Horizons)

Usage
~~~~~

::

   turnips

Format
~~~~~~

A data frame with the following 3 variables.

``date``
   a date

``time``
   a character vector referring to the particular time period of
   observation

``price``
   a numeric vector for the price of turnips, in bells

Details
~~~~~~~

Sunday prices are set for purchase and do not fluctuate. Tommy and Timmy
do not accept turnips on Sunday either. Daily prices fluctuate both at
opening on Nook's Cranny and at noon. This amounts to three time periods
in the data. "5:00 a.m." is reserved only for Sunday purchases (i.e.
when Daisy Mae arrives on the island). 8:00 a.m. is the morning price
because that is when Nook's Cranny opens. 12:00 p.m. is when the price
changes for the day.
