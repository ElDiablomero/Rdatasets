<h2>Simpson's Paradox: Covid</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset on Delta Variant Covid-19 cases in the UK. This dataset gives a great example of Simpson's Paradox. When aggregating results without regard to age group, the death rate for vaccinated individuals is higher &ndash; but they have a much higher risk population. Once we look at populations with more comparable risks (breakout age groups), we see that the vaccinated group tends to be lower risk in each risk-bucketed group and that many of the higher risk patients had gotten vaccinated. The dataset was brought to OpenIntro's attention by Matthew T. Brenneman of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. Note: some totals in the original source differ as there were some cases that did not have ages associated with them.

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 286,166 rows and 3 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>age_group</dt><dd><p>Age of the person. Levels: <code style="white-space: pre;">under 50</code>,  <code style="white-space: pre;">50 +</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>vaccine_status</dt><dd><p>Vaccination status of the person. Note: the vaccinated group includes those who were only partially vaccinated. Levels: <code>vaccinated</code>, <code>unvaccinated</code></p>
</dd>
<dt>outcome</dt><dd><p>Did the person die from the Delta variant? Levels: <code>death</code> and <code>survived</code>.</p>
